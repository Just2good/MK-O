	<Message MaidID="11000512" SelectItem="Like this?" CraftRequest="Leave it to me!" CraftCancel="But I&apos;ve already put so much effort into this!" RecieveItem="I&apos;m done! Do you... do you like it? I hope it meets your expectations!" RecieveJackpot="I&apos;m really proud of this one!" NotEnoughIgd="I&apos;d love to help, but you don&apos;t have all of the materials. You can buy gems from craft material merchants in major towns. You can get $item:40100023$ from dismantling Lv. 20 and above equipment items. Some materials can only be obtained from hunting monsters." Expired='Um, &lt;font color=&quot;#ffd200&quot;&gt;$OwnerName$&lt;/font&gt;...? This might not be the best time, but I just got a call from Helping Hands. My contract with you is up... ' />
	<Message MaidID="11000767" SelectItem="Piece of cake!" CraftRequest="Gotcha, just give me a minute." CraftCancel="Aw, but I was almost done! " RecieveItem="Hey, look at that." RecieveJackpot="Well, not too bad, heh." NotEnoughIgd="I don&apos;t think you have all the materials. Craft material merchants sell most materials, but some can only be obtained by punching monsters." Expired="Aw, man, I&apos;d love to, but my contract expired. Gotta set some boundaries or I&apos;ll go broke, ya know?" />
	<Message MaidID="11000768" SelectItem="You&apos;re determined you want this, aren&apos;t you?" CraftRequest="Do I have to? Fine." CraftCancel="What? I could&apos;ve been napping..." RecieveItem="Just take it." RecieveJackpot="Whoa, even surprised myself with this." NotEnoughIgd="Aw, too bad. I can&apos;t make that without the materials. You&apos;ll have to go all the way to a supply merchant in any major town to buy herbs or hunt some monsters. Some items can only be obtained from monsters. Sounds like you&apos;ll be out for a while. What a shame..." Expired="Our contract expired, so I&apos;m just going to take a nap, okay?" />
	<Message MaidID="11000769" SelectItem="Good, good. Whatever you like." CraftRequest="It may take a few moments." CraftCancel="Pity. It was turning out quite nicely." RecieveItem="All done.  How do you like it?" RecieveJackpot="Must be my lucky day." NotEnoughIgd="I need the right materials. You can obtain $item:40100001$ from supply merchants in major towns and $item:40100023$ from dismantling level 20 and higher equipment. Some materials can only be obtained by hunting monsters." Expired="Ah, if we could take a moment to talk about my contract... I believe it&apos;s expired." />
	<Message MaidID="11000770" SelectItem="That what you want?" CraftRequest="I&apos;ll be done in a jiffy." CraftCancel="Oh, didja change your mind?" RecieveItem="All done!" RecieveJackpot="I had extra materials, so I thought, why the heck not." NotEnoughIgd="I&apos;m fresh outta ingredients. You can buy more from craft material merchants in major towns. Some of the good stuff can only be got by hunting monsters." Expired="Looks like my contract expired, $OwnerName$. Didn&apos;t I warn ya this would happen a coupla days ago? Should&apos;ve done something then, if ya ask me." />
	<Message MaidID="11000771" SelectItem="This, right?" CraftRequest="No sweat." CraftCancel="Are you intentionally giving me a hard time?" RecieveItem="It&apos;s done." RecieveJackpot="Oops, I made more than I intended." NotEnoughIgd="That&apos;s not enough. You can buy most ingredients from craft material merchants in major towns, but some items can only be found by hunting monsters." Expired="$OwnerName$... You let my contract expire. I really need this job! " />
	<Message MaidID="11000772" SelectItem="Recipe found." CraftRequest="Switching to crafting mode." CraftCancel="Switching to recycling mode." RecieveItem="Command executed." RecieveJackpot="System glitch. Command executed in excess. Apologies." NotEnoughIgd="Insufficient resources. Switching to information mode. Most cooking ingredients can be purchased from craft material merchants in major towns. Some cooking ingredients can only be obtained by hunting monsters." Expired="Contract expired. Switching to hibernation mode." />
	<Message MaidID="11000773" SelectItem="Too easy. Tsk." CraftRequest="It&apos;s going to take a while. Wait right there." CraftCancel="Fickle, aren&apos;t we? Tsk." RecieveItem="If you need more, you know where to find me." RecieveJackpot="Sometimes, I even impress myself." NotEnoughIgd="Materials, please? Tsk. Herbs can be purchased from Supply Merchants in major towns or by hunting monsters. Come to think of it, certain herbs can only be found on monsters." Expired="You made a critical mistake, allowing my contract to expire. Now I no longer have reason to listen to you." />
	<Message MaidID="11000774" SelectItem="I&apos;m surging with inspiration!" CraftRequest="Mindfully, now. With intent." CraftCancel="I understand. Everything must be weighed. Sometimes, the cost is too high." RecieveItem="It was worth the wait, wasn&apos;t it?" RecieveJackpot="My muse sang to me for this one." NotEnoughIgd="I create, but not from scratch. You can obtain $item:40100001$ from Supply Merchants in major towns, $item:40100023$ by dismantling Lv. 20 and above equipment, and the rest by hunting monsters." Expired="My contract expired. You&apos;d think it&apos;d freeing to not have any constraints, but beautiful art can be made within the most rigid of circumstances. It forces your creativity to break through! Please renew my contract." />
	<Message MaidID="11000777" SelectItem="You sure are specific..." CraftRequest="I&apos;ll see if I can find one." CraftCancel="You changed your mind?" RecieveItem="It was kind of a hassle." RecieveJackpot="Hm? I did you one better." NotEnoughIgd="Do your job! Get $item:40100001$ from Supply Merchants in major town, $item:40100023$ from dismantling Lv. 20 or above equipment items, and the rest by hunting monsters." Expired="I don&apos;t feel like it. Hey, if you give me some of those pretty blue things, I might change my mind." />
	<Message MaidID="11000778" SelectItem="You want me to make you that?" CraftRequest="Just leave it to me!" CraftCancel="Aww, I was almost done..." RecieveItem="Isn&apos;t it great? It is, becuase I made it!" RecieveJackpot="$OwnerName$! $OwnerName$! Did you see what I made?" NotEnoughIgd="You don&apos;t have enough materials.  You&apos;ll have to go to a supply merchant in any major town to buy herbs or hunt some monsters. Some items can only be obtained from monsters." Expired="I just can&apos;t, not after my contract expires. Not because I don&apos;t want to... Those are just the rules!" />
	<Message MaidID="11000779" SelectItem="Easy enough." CraftRequest="Please wait a moment." CraftCancel="Hm... If you insist..." RecieveItem="Does it meet expectations?" RecieveJackpot="I had extra materials, so I made more." NotEnoughIgd="You need more ingredients. Remember, most items can be purchased from craft material merchants in major towns. Select ingredients can only be found by hunting monsters." Expired="My contract has expired, and I live and breath by contracts. I can&apos;t work until you sign a new one." />
	<Message MaidID="11000780" SelectItem="Oh, that one? You got it!" CraftRequest="Okay. Just wait a bit. You trust me, right?" CraftCancel="Did you change your mind already? Haha! You&apos;re hopeless, you know that?" RecieveItem="Hehe. That was nothing." RecieveJackpot="Huh? Look at this. I had a good feeling this time. Hehe." NotEnoughIgd="Hey, you need the ingredients. You can purchase most cooking ingredients from the craft material merchant in major towns, but some you can only get from hunting monsters." Expired="Wait, my alarm went off. I don&apos;t have a shoot today... What is it? Ah... $OwnerName$... It says my contract expired. " />
	<Message MaidID="11000785" SelectItem="That&apos;s not hard, but..." CraftRequest="Do I... have a choice?" CraftCancel="I was actually trying, too. Oh, well." RecieveItem="Is this what you requested?" RecieveJackpot="I think I made this one extra good. Or, did I? " NotEnoughIgd="How am I supposed to do that when you don&apos;t have all the materials? You can get $item:40100001$ from the Supply Merchant in major towns, $item:40100023$ by dismantling Lv. 20 or higher equipment, and the rest by hunting monsters... Okay?" Expired="How should I put this... My contract expired. I won&apos;t work if you don&apos;t pay me. I&apos;m not a volunteer! Whew, I said it... " />
	<Message MaidID="11000786" SelectItem="You need that?" CraftRequest="Piece of cake." CraftCancel="I was practically done..." RecieveItem="Here. Cherish it." RecieveJackpot="This is great, even for me." NotEnoughIgd="I need more materials. You can buy gems from craft material merchants in major towns. You can get $item:40100023$ from dismantling Lv. 20 and above equipment items. Some materials can only be obtained from hunting monsters." Expired="My contract expired. You&apos;re not really trying to make me work without pay, are you?" />
	<Message MaidID="11000787" SelectItem="Just say the word!" CraftRequest="Just give me some time. I got this." CraftCancel="What? You serious?" RecieveItem="Here&apos;s what you ordered." RecieveJackpot="I wasn&apos;t trying to make this much. But, you know me. Bursting with talent. Haha." NotEnoughIgd="I&apos;m all out of ingredients. You can buy most ingredients from craft material merchants in major towns, but some items can only be found by hunting monsters." Expired="I could give you a list of two dozen reason why asking someone to labor without pay is wrong... Or you could just renew my contract." />
	<Message MaidID="11000788" SelectItem="Oh, that one?" CraftRequest="All right! Time to show what I can do!" CraftCancel="Shall I just toss this, then?" RecieveItem="How is it? You like it? Haha." RecieveJackpot="There I was, minding my own business, when BAM, it turned out like this. Amazing, right?" NotEnoughIgd="I just ran out of ingredients. You can buy most ingredients from craft material merchants in major towns, but some items can only be found by hunting monsters." Expired="Oh no! My contract expired. How can you even eat right now?!" />
	<Message MaidID="11000789" SelectItem="That&apos;ll be easy." CraftRequest="Fine, I&apos;ll give it a try." CraftCancel="Hmph, typical human." RecieveItem="I hope you cherish it." RecieveJackpot="Does it... Does it look better than usual to you, too?" NotEnoughIgd="Not enough materials... You can buy gems from craft material merchants in major towns. You can get $item:40100023$ from dismantling Lv. 20 and above equipment items. Some materials can only be obtained from hunting monsters." Expired='Huh? Wait. &lt;font color=&quot;#ffd200&quot;&gt;$OwnerName$&lt;/font&gt;, my contract expired...' />
	<Message MaidID="11000790" SelectItem="That? Guess I could make it. Better than getting kicked out..." CraftRequest="You&apos;re really askin&apos; an old man like me to work? You&apos;re heartless." CraftCancel="Can you make up your gosh dang mind?!" RecieveItem="Take it or toss it. I don&apos;t need it." RecieveJackpot="Huh? I wasn&apos;t trying to make this much..." NotEnoughIgd="Shouldn&apos;t you give me the materials before making the request? Herbs can be got from Supply Merchants in major towns or by hunting monsters. Some herbs can only be found on monsters." Expired="Hey, our contract expired. You&apos;re still gonna feed me, right?" />
	<Message MaidID="11000791" SelectItem="Are you talking about this?" CraftRequest="I&apos;ll do it! But I&apos;ll need some time." CraftCancel="Do I have to throw this away then?" RecieveItem="It&apos;s complete!" RecieveJackpot="It&apos;s hard to believe I made this." NotEnoughIgd="I can&apos;t since I don&apos;t have enough materials. You can get $item:40100001$ from the Supply Merchant in major towns, $item:40100023$ by dismantling Lv. 20 or higher equipment, and the rest by hunting monsters." Expired="That may be difficult. You see, my contract has expired..." />
	<Message MaidID="11000792" SelectItem="Hm, good idea." CraftRequest="Okay! Just give me some time." CraftCancel="Cancel? Now? What a waste, but what choice do I have?" RecieveItem="This is what you requested, right?" RecieveJackpot="I think I made too much..." NotEnoughIgd="I want to, but I can&apos;t without materials. Herbs can be purchased from Supply Merchants in major towns or by hunting monsters. Actually, certain herbs can only be found on monsters." Expired="Sorry. Nope. I can&apos;t. My contract expired." />
	<Message MaidID="11000793" SelectItem="This one?" CraftRequest="I could do that." CraftCancel="Decide for sure from now on." RecieveItem="How&apos;s this?" RecieveJackpot="Good news! The result was extraordinary." NotEnoughIgd="If you want it, provide the materials. You can buy gems from craft material merchants in major towns. You can get $item:40100023$ from dismantling Lv. 20 and above equipment items. Some materials can only be obtained from hunting monsters." Expired="My contract has expired. Didn&apos;t anyone tell you? There&apos;s no such thing as a free lunch." />
	<Message MaidID="11000794" SelectItem="Do you want that?" CraftRequest="Got it! I&apos;ll try making it without using magic!" CraftCancel="Seriously...?" RecieveItem="All done!" RecieveJackpot="Huh? This looks really good." NotEnoughIgd="I need materials... You can buy gems from craft material merchants in major towns. You can get $item:40100023$ from dismantling Lv. 20 and above equipment items. Some materials can only be obtained from hunting monsters." Expired="I can&apos;t! My contract&apos;s expired! I promised not to work without a contract! " />
	<Message MaidID="11000544" SelectItem="Would you like me to make this for you?" CraftRequest="Rest assured. It shall be done." CraftCancel="What a shame." RecieveItem="As you requested." RecieveJackpot="It&apos;s not too bad, if I do say so myself." NotEnoughIgd="Apologies, but I cannot craft without adequate materials. Production material merchants in major towns sell gems, and $item:40100023$ can be obtained by dismantling Lv. 20 and above equipment items. Some materials can only be obtained through hunting monsters." Expired="Apologies. Company policy prohibits me from working under an expired contract." />
	<Message MaidID="11000764" SelectItem="That&apos;s what you want, hm?" CraftRequest="All right. No peeking!" CraftCancel="What would you like me to do with the one I was making?" RecieveItem="Not bad, huh?" RecieveJackpot="Wow, I did such an amazing job, I kind of want to keep it..." NotEnoughIgd="I can&apos;t do much without the right materials. Craft material merchants in major towns sell gems, and $item:40100023$ can be obtained by dismantling Lv. 20 and above equipment items. Some materials can only be obtained through hunting monsters." Expired="No pay, no service. Simple as that, hon." />
	<Message MaidID="11000758" SelectItem="Is that what you&apos;d like me to cook?" CraftRequest="I&apos;ll start work on that right away." CraftCancel="Oh. Okay." RecieveItem="Here you go. All done." RecieveJackpot="Oh, this is even better than usual." NotEnoughIgd="You don&apos;t have all the ingredients. Most cooking ingredients can be purchased from craft material merchants in major towns, but some can only be found by hunting monsters." Expired="$OwnerName$... My contract has expired. I... Oh, never mind." />
	<Message MaidID="11000759" SelectItem="Is that it?" CraftRequest="You can go about your business while I take care of this for you." CraftCancel="Very well. I&apos;ll just throw this away, then." RecieveItem="Here&apos;s the item you requested." RecieveJackpot="It was not my intention, but I may have made a bit too much..." NotEnoughIgd="Are you asking me to gather materials for you? That is not part of my contract. You can buy herbs from the supply merchant in major towns or gather them yourself by hunting monsters. Some materials can only be obtained by hunting, too." Expired="My contract has expired. I am no longer in your employ." />
